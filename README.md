3 EVENT SEEKING (FOR MERE MORTALS)

SWISSCOM CASE POWERED BY LOCALCITIES.CH
Planning your social life online requires superhuman powers. Although distance filters help people find an event within a certain radius, only superheroes have the ability to fly from A to B in a straight line. There are many event sources to search through and numerous transportation possibilities to consider for mere mortals with a limited budget. So this is your challenge: Develop a next generation event search tool, where users can use innovative filters like; 1) means of transportation, 2) total travel time, and 3) total budget. At the push of a button, users could, for example, find all music events with an entry cost of less than 10 Francs, on Friday night, within a 15 minute bike ride. Together weâ€™ll form a team of hacking superheroes and build an MVP (web or mobile) for event seeking non-superheroes. We will provide you access to a national events database and geolocation APIs. You are of course free to extend with additional data sources from the open data world.
